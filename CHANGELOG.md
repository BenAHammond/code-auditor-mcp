# Changelog

All notable changes to the Code Auditor MCP project.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-07-17

Complete re-architecture. The entire Spec 01–09 arc ships as a single breaking release. The individual spec-architected version increments (2.7.0 through 4.0.1) were never published to npm — this is publish point one.

### Spec 01: Dead Architecture Removal & Canonical Language Layer

- **Removed** archived code: legacy `src/analyzers/` implementations predating the functional analyzer pattern, dead config generators, and the dual entry-point tangle.
- **Established** `LanguageAdapter` as the single seam for language support. All analysis paths consume `LanguageAdapter`; no analyzer imports a language-specific parser directly.
- **Canonical language layer**: `src/languages/` with `LanguageRegistry`, adapter interface (`types.ts`), and one adapter per language.

### Spec 02: MCP Surface Consolidation

- **Breaking**: MCP tool names and entry points consolidated. Seven tools replace the previous fragmented surface.

| v2 tool | v3 tool / action |
|---------|-----------------|
| `start_audit` | `audit.run` |
| `audit_health` | `audit.health` |
| `search_code` | `search.query` |
| `find_definition` | `search.definition` |
| `sync_index` | `index.sync` |
| `generate_ai_config` | removed (CLI `generate-config` for host configs) |
| `get_workflow_guide` | `guide.get` |
| — (new) | `code_map.get` |
| — (new) | `tasks` (create, list, get, update, delete, from_audit) |
| — (new) | `config` (get, set, list, rules_list, rules_check) |

- **Single entry point**: `mcp.ts` as the sole MCP server entry; `cli.ts` for the CLI. `tool-registry.ts` dispatches all tool calls.
- **Fingerprint utility**: stable violation fingerprints for dedup across audit runs.

### Spec 03: SQLite Data Layer

- **Replaced LokiJS** with `better-sqlite3`. The code index, audit results, task list, and config all live in a single SQLite database at `<cwd>/.code-index/index.db`.
- **Replaced FlexSearch** with SQLite FTS5 for full-text search.
- **`content_hash`** added to `EnhancedFunctionMetadata` for diff detection.
- **QueryParser** compiles to SQL via `compileToSQL()`.
- **Migration**: existing LokiJS data is migrated automatically on first run.
- **Tasks survive index reset**: clearing the analysis index does not delete the task list.

### Spec 04: Diff-Scoped Auditing & Agent Hook Integration

- **`code-audit changed`** command audits only files modified since the last index sync.
- **Scope options**: `changed` (default), `git:<ref>`, `[paths...]`, `--stdin`.
- **Hook contract**: `--json`, `--quiet`, `--fail-on <severity>` flags. Exit code 2 on critical violations.
- **Claude Code hook recipe**: `PostToolUse` hook on Edit/Write pipes changed file paths to `code-audit changed --stdin --json --fail-on critical`.
- **Scoped result isolation**: `getMostRecentAuditResults` filters by scope.

### Spec 05: Custom Invariant Rules Engine

- **`.codeauditor.json`** in the project root defines project-specific rules enforced on every audit run.
- **Four initial rule kinds**: `import-ban`, `call-constraint`, `module-boundary`, `naming`.
- **JSON Schema** (`invariant-rules.schema.json`) validates rule configs on startup — bad globs, duplicate IDs, missing fields fail the audit rather than being silently skipped.
- **`config rules_list`** and **`config rules_check`** MCP actions introspect the active ruleset.
- **Rule engine** (`ruleEngine.ts`) runs rules per-file during audits, including diff-scoped runs.

### Spec 06: SARIF Output

- **SARIF formatter** (`sarifReportGenerator.ts`) emits SARIF 2.1.0 for GitHub Code Scanning.
- **CLI**: `code-audit -f sarif -o results.sarif`.
- **CI recipe**: GitHub Actions workflow uploads SARIF to CodeQL for PR annotations.
- **Diff-scoped SARIF**: `code-audit changed --scope git:origin/main -f sarif` with `--sarif-category` for scoped uploads.
- **Stable fingerprints** per violation for dedup in GitHub's SARIF consumer.

### Spec 07: Claude Code Plugin & Skill Packaging (A2 Rework)

- **Skill-first packaging** (A2): The plugin contains manifest, hooks, hook script, and skill. The bundled MCP server was stripped — the skill teaches the CLI; the MCP server remains the standalone path for shell-less hosts.
- **`plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`**: manifest with name `code-auditor`, version synced to package.
- **Repo as marketplace**: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at repo root. Install: `claude plugin marketplace add BenAHammond/code-auditor-mcp` → `claude plugin install code-auditor`.
- **`PostToolUse` hook** on Edit/Write: pipes edited file paths to `code-audit changed --stdin --json --fail-on critical`. Degrades cleanly (exit 0 with notice) when package not installed or no index exists.
- **SKILL.md** rewritten CLI-first: teaches `code-audit changed` before claiming work complete, semantic search operators, `tasks from-audit` remediation queue, and reading invariants at session start.
- **CLI parity subcommands** (A2 R2): `code-audit search`, `code-audit map`, `code-audit tasks` — thin argv adapters over the same service layer as MCP handlers.
- **Rule-kind reference file** in the skill folder documents all five rule kinds including `ast-pattern` (Spec 08).

### Spec 08: tree-sitter Migration & `ast-pattern` Rule Kind

#### tree-sitter Migration

- **Replaced TypeScript compiler API** with tree-sitter behind the `LanguageAdapter` interface. All 16 direct TS consumers migrated to `adapterBridge.ts`.
- **`typescript` moved to `devDependencies`** — the production build no longer depends on the TS compiler.
- **`adapterBridge.ts`**: synchronous facade over tree-sitter parsers — `getASTForFile()`, `walkAST()`, `findNodes()`, `calculateComplexity()`.
- **Real Go adapter**: `GoAdapter.ts` rewritten with `tree-sitter-go` WASM grammar. Previously returned empty ASTs; now parses actual Go source.
- **WASM grammars** shipped at `dist/grammars/` (tree-sitter-typescript, tree-sitter-javascript, tree-sitter-go). Zero native compilation required — `web-tree-sitter` runtime is pure JS.
- **Parser initialization**: `initParsers()` called once at CLI boot / MCP server start. `adapterBridge` throws if used uninitialized — a loud programmer error, never silent.
- **Complexity definition**: Now documented cyclomatic complexity — decision-point count (if, for, while, do, switch_case, ternary, `&&`, `||`) + 1. This is the canonical definition; previous TS-API-based numbers may differ slightly.

#### `ast-pattern` Rule Kind

- **New invariant rule kind**: `ast-pattern` — match AST node patterns in source using `@ast-grep/napi`.
- **Pattern syntax**: ast-grep patterns (e.g., `new Function($$$)` matches any `new Function(...)` call).
- **Language support**: `typescript` (via `tsx` parser), `javascript`. Go is not supported by `@ast-grep/napi` — rules targeting Go will skip gracefully.
- **Configuration fields**: `pattern` (required, non-empty), `language` (optional, defaults to `typescript`), `path` (optional file glob filter).
- **Dogfood rule**: This repo's `.codeauditor.json` includes a `no-new-function` ast-pattern rule banning `new Function()`.

### Spec 09: Positioning Rewrite

- **Repositioned** from "multi-language code quality auditor" to "architectural invariants and code quality analysis, enforced inside your AI agent's edit loop."
- **README rewrite**: 9-section structure, agent-loop-first framing. Invariant rules moved to flagship section. Every example reproducible against the shipped version.
- **Metadata**: `package.json` description and keywords updated. `server.json` description and version updated. `plugin.json` version synced.
- **GitHub About**: updated to the R1 positioning line.

### Mid-series note

The internal version increments spec-architected for individual specs (2.7.0, 3.0.0–4.0.1) were never published to npm. The last published version before this release was 2.6.2. This 3.0.0 release absorbs the entire nine-spec arc into a single breaking release per Amendment A1.
