# Rule Replacement Ledger

Append-only. One entry per rule replaced, renamed, or blocked, in spec-49 order.
Never rewrite earlier entries — this file is the audit trail that the crude
backlog is actually being closed.

## Session 1 — the `single-responsibility` split (spec-49 order #1)

The authenticity ledger's row 25 marked `solid/single-responsibility` crude: a
line-count + parameter-count size proxy masquerading as a responsibility
reading ("largest rule in the tool, 987 on recall"). The concern engine
(`functionConcerns.ts`, #128) and the size-rule split (#131) landed before this
spec was written, so this session pins that work with the spec's TDD evidence
and closes the ledger row.

Three emitted rule IDs changed:

### `function-length`

- **rule**: `function-length`
- **was**: `if (lineCount > (maxLinesPerMethod || 50))` emitted under
  `solid/single-responsibility` — a line count standing in for responsibility
- **now**: the same line-count predicate, emitted under `function-length` — an
  honest name for a length reading. A 52-line function is "2 over a length
  threshold," not an SRP violation
- **tests**: positive (long function fires `function-length`); near-miss
  (cohesive 180-line handler fires `function-length`, *not*
  `single-responsibility`); inverse near-miss (30-line four-concern function
  fires `single-responsibility`, *not* `function-length`)
- **counts** (now; was emitted as the line-count half of `single-responsibility`
  at the same counts — same predicate, new ID):
  recall 902 · knex 60 · primer-css 3 · blitz 88 · hhra-org 381 ·
  gin n/a (Go corpus) · svelte-realworld not on disk
- **adjudication**: survivors are genuinely long functions — what the rule
  claims to measure. No false positives of the "responsibility" kind, because
  the rule no longer claims responsibility
- **verdict**: `renamed` (proxy kept under an honest name)

### `parameter-count`

- **rule**: `parameter-count`
- **was**: `if (func.parameters.length > (maxParametersPerMethod || 4))`
  emitted under `solid/single-responsibility` — a parameter count standing in
  for responsibility
- **now**: the same parameter-count predicate, emitted under `parameter-count`
- **tests**: positive (5-param function fires `parameter-count`); near-miss
  (4-param function does not); inverse near-miss (short function mixing
  concerns fires `single-responsibility`, not `parameter-count`)
- **counts** (now; was emitted as the param-count half of `single-responsibility`
  at the same counts): recall 89 · knex 6 · primer-css 0 · blitz 9 · hhra-org 2 ·
  gin n/a · svelte-realworld not on disk
- **adjudication**: survivors are genuinely many-parameter functions — what the
  rule claims to measure
- **verdict**: `renamed` (proxy kept under an honest name)

### `solid/single-responsibility`

- **rule**: `solid/single-responsibility`
- **was**: `if (params > 4) fire` + `if (lines > 50) fire` — size proxies
  standing in for cohesion (987 on recall)
- **now**: `detectFunctionConcerns` + `countConcernGroups >= 3` — a function
  fires only when it spans three or more *unrelated* concern categories
  (data-access, messaging, logging, rendering), with load-and-shape collapsing
  and nested-body isolation
- **tests**:
  - *positive* — `handler` (db + email + log + render + audit + notify) fires
  - *near-miss* — cohesive 180-line handler does **not** fire (its length fires
    `function-length` instead)
  - *inverse near-miss* — 30-line function doing four unrelated things **does**
    fire (the old size proxy would have missed it)
  - all 8 tests green (`single-responsibility.spec.ts`)
- **counts** (before → after, per corpus):
  recall 991→0 · knex 66→0 · primer-css 3→0 · blitz 97→0 · hhra-org 383→0 ·
  gin n/a (Go — `solid.go` crude SRP is ledger rows 9/10, a later session) ·
  svelte-realworld not on disk.
  "before" is the reconstructed size-proxy count (`function-length` +
  `parameter-count` = the two relabeled halves of the same predicates); the
  spec-44 headline was 987 on recall, the 4-finding delta is corpus drift
  between the spec-44 pin and now.
- **adjudication**: zero survivors — the count is 0 on every corpus, so there
  is nothing to sample. Verified genuine, not a dead engine: a walk of
  recall-protocol's 15,144 functions finds 4,308 with ≥1 concern, 14 with ≥2,
  and **0 with ≥3** (the firing threshold). The 991→0 drop is the proxy firing
  on long/param-heavy-but-cohesive functions that were never god-functions.
- **verdict**: `replaced` (concern engine computes the real signal)
