# Product Steering Document

## Product Vision
Code Auditor is an open-source code quality analysis tool that helps developers identify and fix quality issues in TypeScript/JavaScript codebases. It goes beyond traditional linting by focusing on architectural patterns, complexity, and maintainability.

## Core Mission
Detect code quality issues with a focus on:
- SOLID principle violations
- Code duplication (DRY)
- Security vulnerabilities
- Component complexity
- Data access patterns

The tool should be extensible and flexible enough to accommodate future open source contributions while maintaining high performance.

## Target Users
- Individual developers seeking to improve code quality
- Development teams wanting automated quality checks
- Open source projects needing quality gates
- AI assistants analyzing code through MCP integration

## Key Differentiators
- **vs ESLint**: Focuses on quality and complexity rather than rules and formatting
- **vs Traditional Linters**: Analyzes architectural patterns and design principles
- **Unique Value**: Combines multiple quality aspects (SOLID, DRY, Security) in one tool

## Success Metrics
- **Primary**: Adoption by developers and projects
- **Secondary**: Community contributions of new analyzers
- **Tertiary**: Integration into development workflows

## Product Principles
1. **Performance First**: Must be fast enough for frequent re-runs during development
2. **Actionable Results**: Every issue should have clear, practical recommendations
3. **Zero False Positives**: Better to miss issues than report incorrect ones
4. **Developer Friendly**: Clear output, easy configuration, minimal setup

## Feature Scope
### Current Scope
- TypeScript/JavaScript analysis
- Multiple report formats (HTML, JSON, CSV)
- CLI and programmatic usage
- MCP integration for AI assistants
- Configuration flexibility

### Future Considerations
- YAML/JSON file validation (within TypeScript ecosystem)
- Additional analyzers via community contributions
- Enhanced performance optimizations
- Integration with more development tools

### Out of Scope
- Other programming languages (unless contributed)
- Cloud services or dashboards
- Paid features or enterprise editions
- Auto-fixing capabilities (analysis only)
