# Bug Verification: Code Analyzers Not Detecting Issues

## Verification Plan

### Test Cases
1. Verify SOLID analyzer detects class with too many methods
2. Verify DRY analyzer detects duplicate code blocks
3. Verify Security analyzer detects SQL injection
4. Verify Component analyzer detects deep nesting
5. Verify DataAccess analyzer detects N+1 queries

### Success Criteria
- [x] Each analyzer detects at least one violation in test files (CLI works)
- [ ] Appropriate severity levels assigned
- [ ] Clear violation messages provided
- [ ] MCP tools return violation data (needs restart)
- [ ] Health score reflects actual code quality

### Regression Tests
- Test files created in `test-bad-code/src/` with intentional violations
- CLI successfully detects 6 violations when run directly
- MCP server needs restart to pick up fixes

## Results

### Fixes Applied
1. **AST Parser Fix**: Simplified TypeScript parsing to avoid library definition errors
2. **Config Initialization**: Added config initialization to all analyzer constructors
3. **MCP Path Fix**: Added projectRoot parameter to MCP tool handlers

### Current Status
- **CLI**: ✅ Working - detects 6 violations in test code
- **Direct Analyzer Calls**: ✅ Working - 83 SOLID + 9 Security violations found
- **MCP Server**: ⚠️ Needs restart - still running old code without fixes

### Test Output
```bash
# CLI Test
cd test-bad-code && node ../dist/cli.js
# Result: Found 6 violations (0 critical, 6 warnings, 0 suggestions)
```

### Next Steps
1. Restart MCP server to load fixed code
2. Verify all analyzers detect appropriate violations
3. Check DRY and Component analyzers for implementation issues (currently 0 violations)
4. Ensure DataAccess analyzer is properly registered

## Final Results

### Bug Fixes Applied:
1. ✅ **AST Parser**: Fixed TypeScript parsing that was preventing any analysis
2. ✅ **Config Initialization**: Added missing config initialization in all analyzers
3. ✅ **MCP Path Parameter**: Fixed MCP server to use provided path parameter
4. ✅ **DRY Normalization**: Fixed code normalization that collapsed all code to 1 line
5. ✅ **SQL Injection Detection**: Implemented missing SQL injection checks in Security analyzer

### Test Results with CLI:
- **Before fixes**: 0 violations detected
- **After fixes**: 55 violations detected (41 critical, 13 warnings, 1 suggestion)

### Analyzer Status:
- **SOLID**: ✅ Working - detects complexity, responsibilities, method counts
- **Security**: ✅ Enhanced - now detects SQL injection + error handling issues
- **DRY**: ✅ Fixed - normalization issue resolved (needs MCP restart)
- **Component**: ⚠️ Partial - checks architecture but not complexity/nesting
- **DataAccess**: ⚠️ Partial - registered but needs N+1 query detection

### Remaining Work:
1. **Component Analyzer**: Needs implementation of nesting depth and complexity checks
2. **DataAccess Analyzer**: Needs implementation of N+1 query detection
3. **MCP Server**: Needs restart to pick up all fixes
