# Bug Report: Code Analyzers Not Detecting Issues

## Bug Summary
The code quality analyzers are not detecting any violations when analyzing intentionally problematic code. All analyzers return 0 violations despite obvious issues being present.

## Environment
- **Project**: code-auditor
- **Version**: Initial development
- **Affected Components**: All analyzers (SOLID, DRY, Security, Component, DataAccess)
- **Test Framework**: Test files with known issues created

## Expected Behavior
When analyzing the test files with intentional code quality issues, the analyzers should detect:
- SOLID violations in UserService.ts (20+ methods, mixed responsibilities)
- DRY violations in OrderProcessor.ts (triple duplication of logic)
- Security violations in endpoints.ts (SQL injection, missing auth)
- Component violations in SuperComplexComponent.tsx (deep nesting, complexity)
- Data access violations in DataComponent.tsx (N+1 queries, direct DB access)

## Actual Behavior
- All analyzers return 0 violations
- Health score shows 100% (perfect) for obviously problematic code
- No error messages or warnings generated
- Audit completes successfully but finds no issues

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Created test directory with intentionally bad code: `test-bad-code/src/`
2. Added files with specific violations:
   - UserService.ts: God class with 20+ methods
   - OrderProcessor.ts: Massive code duplication
   - endpoints.ts: SQL injection vulnerabilities
   - SuperComplexComponent.tsx: 8+ nesting levels
   - DataComponent.tsx: N+1 queries
3. Ran audit via MCP tools:
   ```
   mcp__node-auditor__audit_run({ path: "/test-bad-code" })
   mcp__node-auditor__audit_analyze_file({ filePath: "UserService.ts" })
   ```
4. Result: 0 violations detected

## Test Code Examples

### SOLID Violation (UserService.ts)
- Class with 20+ methods
- Mixed responsibilities: user CRUD, email, analytics, caching, logging
- Direct SQL with string concatenation
- Plain text password comparison

### DRY Violation (OrderProcessor.ts)
- Same validation logic repeated 3 times
- Same calculation logic repeated 3 times
- Same save pattern repeated 3 times
- Duplicate string literals

### Security Violations (endpoints.ts)
- No authentication checks on delete endpoints
- SQL injection via string concatenation
- Command injection vulnerability
- Logging sensitive data (passwords)

## Impact
- Cannot validate code quality
- False confidence in code health
- Tool is not serving its core purpose
- Tests cannot pass until analyzers work

## Additional Context
- MCP server integration appears to work (returns valid JSON)
- File discovery might be working (reports 29 files analyzed)
- Analyzers might not be properly instantiated or invoked
- No error handling to indicate analyzer failures

## Proposed Investigation Areas
1. Verify analyzers are being instantiated in AuditRunner
2. Check if analyzeFile methods are being called
3. Validate AST parsing is working correctly
4. Ensure file content is being passed to analyzers
5. Debug the analyzer pattern matching logic
